      <h3>+ bio</h3>
      <p>I got my start in journalism as a dual enrollment student at Guilford College in Greensboro, N.C. My senior year, I was faced with the choice of either Victorian literature or journalism to fulfill an English requirement. I chose the student newspaper, where I investigated <a href="https://www.guilfordian.com/news/2015/04/17/salary-inequity/">spurious retention bonuses</a>
        and revealed the college built a coffeeshop <a href="https://www.guilfordian.com/news/2015/02/27/construction-confusion-the-greenleaf-is-still-closed/"> without a building permit.</a> I've been hooked since then.</p>
      <p>In May 2018, I graduated from Virginia Tech summa cum laude with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics. While I was at Tech, I served in a number of roles for the student newspaper, The Collegiate Times, ranging from local government beat reporter to editor in chief. I led the paper through cuts to our print schedule and grew our online audience while covering university and local news.</p>
      <p>After I graduated, I interned for the Daily Press before I was hired as a breaking news reporter in July 2018. I covered a morning cops shift and other general assignment topics including higher education and transportation before I took over the Peninsula education beat in March 2020.</p>
      <p>I currently cover K-12 and higher education in Newport News, Hampton and surrounding cities and counties in southeastern Virginia. Although I’ve written about everything from <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/history/article_831e8706-a70c-11e9-8baf-877b39f0f39b.html">UFOs</a> to a <a href="https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-nw-buckroe-pier-barge-update-20191119-oapbqzdtwvhw7kz2a3ii4hatem-story.html">shipwrecked barge,</a> my main areas of interest include state education policy and funding, teaching and learning in the pandemic, community colleges and equity and inclusion efforts.</p>
      <p>I’m nonbinary and use they/them pronouns. Outside of work, I’m an avid hiker and pianist who’s trying to get better at cooking. I have the personality of a feral oppossum. I'm not going to explain that.</p>
