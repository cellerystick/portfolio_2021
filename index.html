      <p>I was a teenager when 61% of North Carolina voters voted for Amendment 1, defining marriage as between “one man and one woman” in the state constitution.</p>
      <p>Growing up in Greensboro, I had considered the fact that I might be queer. The possibility that I might not be straight was terrifying. I heard the jokes from my classmates, watched the evening news, read the op-eds in the paper.</p>
      <p>The lack of access, representation and compassion in journalism helped uphold the status quo then. It still does now. Done well, journalism is a catalyst for change and a force for good. But when journalists are disconnected from their communities and all of the people in them, it does a disservice to everyone.</p>
      <p>I’ve been a journalist professionally since I graduated Virginia Tech with a degree in mathematics in 2018. I went on to intern for the Daily Press before being hired as a breaking news reporter in July 2018.</p>
      <p>Currently, I’m a news planner for Gannett, helping newspapers in Illinois and Indiana coordinate and plan their coverage. I’ve covered a number of different beats and topics as a reporter, including education, state politics and crime for The Virginian-Pilot and Daily Press. Although I’ve written about a little bit of everything, some focuses include education policy and equity, particularly trans kids.</p>
      <p>I’m trans myself — I use they/them and she/her pronouns to refer to myself. My passion is building better journalism, coverage that really listens to communities and responds to them, whatever that may look like.</p>

      <p class="article_desc">(8/2/21) For a new generation — for Cox, her students and staff — this post-pandemic school year brings new questions and a new chance to define the school. What is the Johnson legacy?</p>

      <p class="article_desc">(7/24/21) Legally, boards are required to pass policies consistent with the model policies — not the model policies themselves. The legislation that requires the policies doesn’t include any mechanism to punish boards for not following.</p>

      <p class="article_desc">(5/29/21) Flush with cash from federal coronavirus relief funding and facing pressure from parents and marketers to ensure clean air in schools, some local districts have invested in unproven technology that experts say doesn’t work or could even make air quality worse.</p>
